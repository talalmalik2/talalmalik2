# Hi, I'm Talal 👋 

### 🚀 Software Engineering Student | Focused on Music Information Retrieval (MIR)
I build tools that bridge the gap between AI and the Spotify listener experience.

---

## 🎧 Featured Project: [Spotify Pulse AI](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spotify-pulse)
> *An intelligent recommendation engine that goes beyond the "Daily Mix."*

I used my background in **Artificial Intelligence (CS50AI)** and **Computer Science (CS50x)** to create a tool that analyzes the acoustic features of your top tracks (tempo, energy, valence) and suggests new music using a K-Nearest Neighbors approach.

### 🛠 Core Capabilities:
* **Feature Extraction:** Fetches real-time data from the Spotify Web API.
* **AI Logic:** Filters recommendations based on user-defined "mood" parameters.
* **OAuth 2.0:** Secure user authentication for personalized data access.

---

### 🧠 Technical Foundation
While I am currently focused on music tech, my engineering foundation is built on:
* **AI & Algorithms:** Proficient in Search, Optimization, and Neural Networks.
* **Software Architecture:** Hands-on experience building interactive systems in Java and C.
* **Systems Thinking:** Background in logistics optimization and automotive diagnostics.
